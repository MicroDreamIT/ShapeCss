##Intro
We found making geometrical shape is not easy but its cumbersome, and need to write many lines of css and javascripts. So we wanted to make it flexable like tag, like h1, h2 or p or body.

##Example
```html
<circle></circle> //basic circle, easy right?
<circle shape-background="blue" shape-radius="400px"><circle> //circle with radius 400px and background blue
```
