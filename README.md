##Intro
We found making geometrical shape is not easy but its cumbersome, and need to write many lines of css and javascripts. So we wanted to make it flexable like tag, like h1, h2 or p or body. So you can use this tags, **circle**, **triangle**, **square**, **rectangle**, **parallelogram**. 

> Please download this two files from [here](https://github.com/MicroDreamIT/ShapeCss/tree/master/lib)

> or you can try **```html 
<link href="https://www.shapecss.com/public/shape.css" rel="stylesheet">

<script src="https://www.shapecss.com/public/shape.js"></script>```**

##Example
```html
<!--basic circle, easy-->
<circle></circle> 

<!--circle with radius 400px and background blue-->
<circle shape-background="blue" shape-radius="400px"><circle> 
```
